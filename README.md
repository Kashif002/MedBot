# MedBot
It is a medical assistant chatbot that recommends medicine according to the symptoms



Working of Medbot

Our chatbot was developed using the open-source machine learning framework TensorFlow. We 
can assist users with any questions or inquiries they may have. As part of our technique, we'll create 
an API for chatbots using Keras, which will allow for quick testing, and we'll utilise Python 3.0 to 
control the bot. Chatbots also incorporate many machine learning algorithms to learn from user 
comments and requests. The full system architecture is represented in Fig.

The Interface and Execution of the MedBot (A Medical Assistant Chatbot)

We'll build a chatbot using deep learning in this Python source code project. This information includes 
categories (intents), patterns and responses and will be used to train the chatbot. To determine which 
category a user's message belongs to, we use a specialized recurrent neural network (LSTM), after 
which we choose a random response from a list of possibilities.
